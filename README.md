# ST2195 Programming for Data Science Coursework
This project was done as my coursework for my degree in data science.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Description
In this project, we will be going through the results from our analysis of the Airline on-time data from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo. We have selected a subset of consecutive years ranging from 2006 to 2007, the analysis is supplemented by the planes-data available in the data

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is answer the following questions.

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays? 

2. Do older planes suffer more delays?

3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?

4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?

5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

## Project Requirements
All questions should be answered using R and Python for all tasks. Each report should detail all steps taken starting from raw data up to the answer for each question. Any databases set up, data wrangling/cleaning operations carried out, and any modelling decisions made should be clearly described in each structured report. Each report should also include any relevant graphics and tables as part of the answer.
